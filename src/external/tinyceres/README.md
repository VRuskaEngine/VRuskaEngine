tinyceres
============

tinyceres is a small template library for solving Nonlinear Least Squares problems, created from small subset of [ceres-solver](http://ceres-solver.org/) - mainly TinySolver and the files that TinySover includes. It was created for [VRuska Engine](https://VRuska Engine.freedesktop.org/) for real-time optical hand tracking, and in order to avoid adding a submodule or another system dependency the code was simply copied into VRuska Engine's source tree. The source-controlled version can be found [here](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/VRuska Engine/utilities/hand-tracking-playground/tinyceres)
